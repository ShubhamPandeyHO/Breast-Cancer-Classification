# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Breast cancer poses a significant health risk, affecting a substantial portion of the global female population. With a prevalence rate of 25% among all cancer cases and impacting over 2.1 million individuals in 2015 alone, it represents a critical area of concern. Characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells within the breast, the disease often manifests as detectable lumps or abnormalities visible via diagnostic imaging techniques like X-rays.

One of the foremost challenges in combating breast cancer lies in effectively distinguishing between malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. In this project, we aim to address this challenge through a comprehensive analysis utilizing machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and neural networks. Leveraging the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, our focus is on thoroughly understanding the dataset and performing necessary cleanup procedures. 

Furthermore, our approach involves the construction of classification models that can accurately predict the nature of a tumor (Malignant or Benign). Through the utilization of both neural networks and machine learning techniques, we intend to develop robust models capable of discerning between the two tumor types. The process will include meticulous hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. To ensure comprehensive analysis, we will compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms, enabling us to identify the most effective and efficient approach for accurate tumor classification. 

This project draws inspiration from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, sourced from Kaggle. Our overarching objective is to contribute to the advancement of breast cancer detection and classification through the intelligent application of machine learning techniques.
